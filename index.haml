                Enny moved to New Zealand from Switzerland in 2009 after an extensive career in banking to fulfil his passion for film and television. He attended South Seas Film and Television School and after a soul searching tour of Aotearoa, he felt in love with New Zealand and made Auckland his home.
              %p
                When Richard decided to start KickArts, he approached Enny to be the TV Reviewer/Co-Host, since then the two are an inseparable couple… well only on Sundays from 8.35 till 10.05 (thank you Imogen!).
              %p
                Enny freelances in the media industry on numerous interesting projects mostly for <a href="http://www.webkea.co.nz" target='_blank'>WebKea</a>. He is an indipendent editor, web designer, producer, director with a high level of artistic skill and a magnificent eye for detail.

                Carolynn was imported from the UK a dozen years ago and has grown here like a weed ever since. She has no background in The Arts whatsoever, clearly making her the ideal choice as a reviewer for this show.
              %p
                Worse than that, she’s one of those people who prefers craft to creativity, and thinks writers, directors, sound & lighting crew, event organisers, designers and administrators should get far more credit than they currently do.
              %p
                When she’s not doing something in a dimly lit room for KickArts she’s either trying to organise the heck out of something, or watching a Scandinavian detective show with her partner and her cat.

                Catherine has had a long involvement with the arts, starting with entertaining her nanny’s Meals on Wheels recipients with her rendition of Tom Jones “What’s New Pussycat” aged 4. This highlight was soon trumped by performing in Joseph and his Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat alongside a very young Rob Guest.
              %p
                Passionate about all things arts, but particularly children’s and youth theatre and the development of emerging artists, Catherine is on the Board of the National Youth Theatre Company and Auckland Fringe Trust. Catherine’s day job is as a Senior Advisor at the ASB Community Trust, where she has worked for several years.
              %p
                When not going to theatre, talking about theatre or working behind the scenes in a variety of guises, she spends her spare time art journaling and singing along to Taylor Swift and Biffy Clyro in the car with her long suffering partner and 3 teenage sons.
